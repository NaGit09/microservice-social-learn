# Recommended New Features for Microservice-Social-Learn

Based on the current project structure (`auth`, `post`, `message`, `notification`, `upload`, `recomment`) and the goal of a "social learning" platform, here are 5 recommended features ranked by impact and feasibility.

## 1. Study Groups / Communities (High Impact)
**Why?**
Currently, the feed appears to be global or user-centric. "Learning" happens best in focused groups (e.g., "Python Beginners", "Calculus 101").

**How to implement:**
*   **New Service**: `group-service` (or expand `post-service`).
*   **Features**: Create groups, join/leave, role management (admin/moderator), and group-specific feeds.
*   **Tech**: Relational DB (Postgres) to map `User` <-> `Group`.

## 2. Q&A System with "Accepted Answers" (Core "Learn" Feature)
**Why?**
Differentiates a "Social Learning" platform from a standard social network. Users need to ask questions and identify the *correct* answer quickly.

**How to implement:**
*   **Update**: Modify `post-service` to include a `PostType` enum (`STANDARD`, `QUESTION`).
*   **Features**: Allow the OP (Original Poster) to "Mark as Solution". Add specialized sorting (unanswered questions first).

## 3. Real-time Collaboration / Whiteboard
**Why?**
Essential for explaining concepts remotely and visually.

**How to implement:**
*   **Frontend**: Integrate a canvas library (like Fabric.js or Konva).
*   **Backend**: Use standard WebSockets (like your current `message-service`) to sync drawing coordinates in real-time.

## 4. Interactive Polls & Quizzes
**Why?**
Increases engagement and allows users to test their knowledge immediately.

**How to implement:**
*   **Update**: Add a `Poll` schema to `post-service`.
*   **Features**: Users can vote on options. Results update in real-time.

## 5. AI Learning Assistant
**Why?**
Leverages the "Learning" aspect. You already have a Python service (`recomment-service`) which could be expanded.

**How to implement:**
*   **Feature**: "Explain this post" button, or an AI chatbot that can answer questions based on the course material shared.
*   **Tech**: Integration with OpenAI/Gemini APIs.
